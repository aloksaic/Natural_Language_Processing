About NFL Tickets
NFL Regular Season Tickets
After the NFL Preseason, which begins on August 4, 2022, the NFL Regular Season will kick off on September 8, 2022. Once again, teams will be playing 17 regular season games over an 18-week season — with select games taking place in London, Germany and Mexico. The regular season is scheduled to end on January 8, 2023, leading into the NFL Playoffs.
 
NFL Playoffs Tickets
After the regular season, the top 14 teams from the National and American Conferences enter the NFL Postseason. Like previous years, only the top seed from each conference will receive a bye with the remaining 12 teams playing on Wild Card Weekend, taking place January 14–16, 2023.
The teams that win during the Wild Card round will advance to  the Divisional round, scheduled to take place January 21–22, 2023. The subsequent victors move on to the NFC and AFC Championship games to battle it out for a spot in Super Bowl LVII. You won’t want to miss this truly action-packed experience, so be sure to grab your NFL Playoffs tickets in advance.
After the top two teams are decided, the 2023 NFL Pro Bowl will be held on February 5, 2023, at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida — bringing together the best players in the league one week prior to Super Bowl LVII. Be sure to grab your tickets to this highly anticipated annual event.
 
Super Bowl Tickets
Super Bowl LVII will be played on February 12, 2023, at the fabulous State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. You’ll definitely want to take this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to witness history-in-the-making live from the stands as the two best teams in the NFL battle it out for the ultimate title.
