If you are making a Purchase on behalf of someone else, the Terms contained in this Policy shall also apply to that person(s) and it is your duty to inform such person(s) of this Policy. Please read this Policy carefully prior to making a Purchase from Provider via this website or mobile software (the "Experiences Platform"), a third party platform you may be directed to ("Ticketing Platform"), or any other medium (e.g., phone) from which you are making a Purchase. This Policy is subject to, and is in addition to, any other information posted by Provider and/or an Experiences Platform or third party platform, including, without limitation, the **[https://www.dallascowboys.com/terms/], **[https://www.dallascowboys.com/privacy-policy/] and all applicable third party platform policies. Provider reserves the right to amend this Policy at any time by posting an updated version.By making a purchase of pass(es) (e.g., pregame or post game field passes), experience(s), access or any other item(s) (e.g., club pass), or combination of any of the foregoing (each, a "Purchase") to an event (e.g. sporting) (collectively the "Event(s)") you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in this Policy, the back of any ticket, pass or event credentials of any kind (collectively, "Pass(es)"), the terms and conditions of any third-party service provider (ticket, suite, etc.), the terms and conditions of any third-party event/game organizer (NFL, NCAA, etc.) or venue, as well as the **[https://www.dallascowboys.com/terms/] and **[https://www.dallascowboys.com/privacy-policy/]. Do not make a Purchase, attend the Events related to your Purchase or enter into any transaction with Provider, if you do not agree to these Policies. Failure to comply with this Policy shall result in forfeiture of this license and all rights arising under it without refund and entitles Provider to pursue all legal remedies available. Admission may be refused or revoked, and Purchaser may be ejected in the sole discretion of Provider. Be sure to return to this Policy periodically to review the most current version of the Policy.

NO REFUNDS, NO EXCHANGES, NO RESALE, NOT REDEEMABLE FOR CASH. Applicable Purchases can be transferred to another individual. Some Purchases are not available for transfer (i.e., field passes) and will be noted within the Experience Platform prior to Purchase. Follow the transfer instructions within the Purchase confirmation email to complete a transfer of a Purchase to another individual within the Experiences Platform and/or the Ticketing Platform, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, the receiving individual of a transfer will be bound by this Policy. Provider shall not be obligated to provide you with your Purchase (or any element thereof) until Provider receives the full and timely payment of the total fee owed as reflected in the sale. If your Purchase includes Passes or other deliverables, they will be delivered to you in accordance with the policies established by Provider as disclosed to you at the time of your purchase. Provider is not responsible for lost, stolen, destroyed, duplicated, counterfeit Pass or Passes obtained from sources other than a representative of Provider and may refuse to honor such Passes. Provider makes no representations nor has any obligation to Purchaser or any subsequent Pass holder that any particular player(s) or performer(s) will appear in the Event. Any changes requested by you to your Purchase after your Purchase is complete, to the extent permitted by Provider in its sole discretion, shall result in additional costs. Confirm all details of your Purchase prior to completing the same.Instructions for onsite Pass pick up will be emailed to Purchaser once Purchase is complete. All sales and transfer options will close forty-eight (48) hours prior to the Event.Your Purchase is a revocable license that only grants a one-time entry use of the specific Pass purchased for the specified Event. YOU MUST HAVE A SEPARATE EVENT TICKET TO GAIN ENTRANCE INTO THE EVENT. You must comply with all event's and stadium's policies, including without limitation any security and fan conduct policies, health and safety protocols, policies and assessments, and any bag policies. Provider reserve the right, without refund of any portion of the price paid or other compensation to you, to refuse admission or to eject any person from any Event or other elements of your Purchase, and/or withdraw or refuse to begin services or provide goods to any person, who fails to comply with this Policy or policies put in place for an Event, the rules of an applicable third party, and/or applicable local, state or federal law or ordinance, in whole or in part, or whose conduct is deemed by Provider or the applicable third party as disorderly, annoying, illegal, vulgar, abusive, threatening, uncomfortable, aggressive, or out of compliance with this Policy or the applicable third party's terms, conditions, rules or policies (all of the above in this sentence, collectively, "Removal Behavior").Except to the extent permitted by applicable federal, state or local law, statute, regulation or ordinance, all the elements of your Purchase may not be resold or offered for resale without Provider's consent, which may be withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any resale in violation of this Policy or applicable law will invalidate your Purchase and revoke any license granted (t)hereunder. Furthermore, you shall not use your Purchase (or any element thereof) for advertising, marketing, promotions or any other commercial purposes, including, without limitation, contests, auctions, sweepstakes and giveaways, without the express written consent of Provider, which may be withheld, conditioned or delayed.Before making a Purchase, carefully review your Event, the Event information and your selections. You agree that you will not attempt to evade, avoid, or circumvent any refund prohibitions in any manner with regards to tickets and/or Passes you purchased, including seeking a chargeback. In connection with your Purchase you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to the transaction, including, without limitation, payment information. Provider accepts several methods of payment to accommodate your needs, including most major credit cards. You represent and warrant that any credit card information that you submit to Provider is true, accurate and complete, and you agree to immediately notify us if any information is inaccurate. You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment methods used in connection with a transaction.When making a Purchase using a credit card, you authorize Provider to charge your credit card at the time you make the reservation and in accordance with any future payment dates agreed upon at the time of sale. You are solely responsible for any and all fees charged to your credit card by the card issuer, bank or financial institution, including, without limitation any credit card membership, overdraft or over-the-credit-limit fees. Some banks and credit card companies impose fees for international transactions. If you are making a Purchase from outside of the United States on a U.S. credit card, your bank may convert the payment amount to your local currency and charge you a conversion fee.Upon completing your Purchase, you agree that the credit card that you use will be charged. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you will not seek a chargeback from the company whose credit card you used to make your Purchase or any portion thereof. Should you do so, your Purchase (including the elements thereof) may be canceled, and Provider may, in our sole discretion, refuse to honor pending and future purchases. The price of your Purchase reflects not only the Passes for the Event, if included, but also costs related to access to the other elements of the Purchase. As a result, please be aware that prices listed may be substantially higher than the original face value price of any Pass included in your Purchase or on the face of the Pass.Unless otherwise noted, the total fee of your Purchase is inclusive of all applicable sales or use taxes, except as specified on specific elements of your Purchase. Accordingly, unless determined otherwise by a legitimate taxing authority, you shall not be liable for additional payment of sales or use taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall pay and/or be responsible for paying any applicable taxes not included in the total fee regardless of when or upon whom such taxes may be levied, assessed or imposed by any such legitimate taxing authority. If such taxes are not collected directly from you by any such legitimate taxing authority and paid by Provider directly, all such taxes shall be immediately due and payable by you to and upon demand by Provider. You shall reimburse Provider for any fees, penalties or interest paid by Provider with respect to such sales or use taxes.Though Pass prices constantly fluctuate on the open market based on demand, Provider's prices are deemed final for you once your order is confirmed. Once your order has been confirmed, if the price of any Pass(es) included in your Purchase increases prior to the Event, you will not be charged for the difference. Alternatively, if the price of the Pass(es) included in your Purchase decreases prior to the Event, no refunds or upgrades will be given. If your order has not been confirmed in writing, your order may be subject to cancellation. All prices are listed in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Occasionally, Pass prices are inadvertently listed incorrectly on the website. In these rare instances, if your order has not been confirmed, Provider may cancel your order and your card will not be charged. If your order has been confirmed, you will be refunded in full and may purchase a Pass at the correct price if available. In both of these scenarios you may receive an email or phone call advising you of your options or that your order has been canceled.All times listed are local for the Event. Event dates, times, and venue are printed on the face of the Passes, website, and/or the Experiences Platform, but are always subject to change. This information should be verified by you prior to the Event. It is important to consult your local media or the Event's official website to ensure that you arrive at the Event on the correct date, time, and at the correct venue. Provider is not responsible for notifying you of date, time, or venue changes. In the event that you were not able to gain admission to the Event with the Passes that were delivered, you must obtain documentation from the venue stating that the Passes were unusable in order for Provider to be able to process a refund.3. Refunds and ExchangesUNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED IN WRITING, ALL SALES AND PURCHASES ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. NO REFUNDS, NO EXCHANGES, NO RESALE, NOT REDEEMABLE FOR CASH. THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR EXCHANGES FOR ILLNESSES, EMERGENCIES, OR ANY OTHER UNEXPECTED CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING YOUR ATTENDANCE AT THE EVENT. THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY if admission is refused or revoked, stadium capacity limitations result in Purchaser's pass(es) being cancelled, or the Event is cancelled and not rescheduled or replayed for any reason, is a refund of up to the face value of the Pass set by Provider ("Face Value").4. Canceled or Postponed Events (Non-Refundable unless otherwise noted by Provider)The location, date and time of an Event and any other elements of your Purchase are subject to change (including, but not limited to, cancellation, postponement or relocation) by Provider, the Event organizer, venue owner or other third party responsible for the staging of an Event or other elements of your Purchase (collectively, the "Organizers"), respectively, in each of their sole discretion, and no such change shall entitle you to a refund or any other remedy in the event that you cannot attend for any reason due to such change unless agreed to in writing by Provider. Any element of your Purchase may be canceled, postponed, delayed, altered, relocated or rescheduled at any time with or without notice in the Organizers' sole discretion, as applicable, or due to the actions or events beyond the reasonably foreseeable control of the Organizers, the Organizers will not be liable to you or any other party because of any failure to perform hereunder due to fire, earthquake, rain, adverse weather conditions, flood, or any other acts of God, power failures, electrical or mechanical difficulties, strikes, lockout, work stoppages or other labor disturbances, governmental regulations or restrictions, terrorism, war, civil disturbances, epidemic, pandemic (including COVID-19), NFL rules and regulations, or any other cause or condition, whether known or unknown, or similar or dissimilar to any of the foregoing, beyond the reasonably foreseeable control of the Organizers ("Force Majeure"). Delay in the performance of this Policy or the failure of Provider to perform or provide the Purchase (or any element thereof) caused by any Force Majeure shall not constitute a breach of this Policy or a ground for cancellation, suspension or termination hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, postponement, relocation or cancellation of Events due to weather conditions or Force Majeure events is beyond our control and Provider will not issue any refund or exchange for such events, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Provider. If an Event is cancelled for any other reason, refunds for Passes will be made at the sole discretion of Provider or in accordance with the applicable law. Your Purchase is considered as a "rain or shine" final Purchase. If an Event is canceled, postponed or rescheduled Provider will not refund incidental expenses that you may have incurred as a result of your plans to attend the Event including, but not limited to, transportation expenses, hotel reservations, or rental car costs. Provider is not responsible for the actions of any other Organizers when an Event is canceled. If an Event is postponed or rescheduled, please retain your Pass. In most cases, elements of the original Purchase and any Pass(es) will be honored for the new Event date and a new Pass(es) will not need to be reissued. Refunds or exchanges will not be made for postponed, relocated or rescheduled Events and you shall only be entitled to attend the rescheduled Event. It is your responsibility to verify information regarding rescheduled Event dates and times prior to attending. Schedules, performers, participants, teams, production elements, amenities, and all other aspects of your Purchase are subject to change without notice and without grounds for refund. If Provider issues you a refund for a Purchase, or a Pass individually, Provider will issue a refund of the Pass' Face Value and a refund will be limited only to the portion of the Purchase that was unable to be consumed due to such cancellation. In no event will delivery charges or any other amounts be refunded.5.
