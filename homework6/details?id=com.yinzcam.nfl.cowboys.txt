Once I get past the fact that I can only listen to the broadcasts while inside the stadium, it's not even useful for watching the stats during the game because it crashes. The only thing it does right is sending scoring notifications to your phone if you manage to get that set up before it crashes.2 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoHarry .Simmsmore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyNovember 22, 2021Update : They have now added a choice of regular or stadium mode. There is no setting to lock in one mode so you have to select everytime. Good reporting in the app but very poor execution. They obviously have no concern for usability. I like the app and it functions OK with one major exception. Upon opening the app, a video autoplays and there is no setting to stop this action. There is a pause button on the screen but it does not work. Autoplay without user controls should not be allowed.257 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoTim Lopezmore_vert Flag inappropriateDecember 21, 2022Podcasts continue to have a loading error at random times while listening. You have to go back in and try to figure out where it was cut off. Doesn't matter if you're connected to wifi or phone network.6 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsWhat's newBug fixes and performance enhancements.flagFlag as inappropriateDeveloper contactexpand_morelanguageWebsitehttp://www.dallascowboys.comemailEmailcowboys.support@yinzcam.comverified_userPrivacy policyhttp://redirect.yinzcam.com/1/860218Similar appsarrow_forwardMiami - Football Live ScoreSport Games Scores4.2starDetroit Lions MobileYinzCam, Inc.4.1starMLB BallparkMLB Advanced Media, L.P.4.5starHibbett | City Gear: SneakersHibbett Sports4.2starABC7 Chicago News & WeatherDisney4.2starABC7 Los AngelesDisney3.9starMore by Dallas Cowboysarrow_forwardMedia GuideDallas Cowboys3.3starCowboys NowDallas Cowboys4.2starDallas Cowboys Star MagazineDallas Cowboys4.5starflagFlag as inappropriateGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policyKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharingTerms of ServicePrivacyAbout Google PlayDevelopersGoogle StoreUnited States (English (United States))
