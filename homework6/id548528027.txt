    Dallas Cowboys


If you are a Dallas Cowboys fan this application is for you. Whether it is the latest news regarding the team, media videos, gallery images of events and stadiums, team information such as roster, statistics, schedule and game day breakdown, radio coverage, Fantasy, social media feeds of players  or AT&T stadium information this app has something for you. The design works well in providing a simple yet comprehensive framework to navigate to a section you are interested in or being able to modify settings such as team push notifications whether it be for breaking news or game scores. The Dallas Cowboys application serves as a great companion to those who are invested or even just casually interested in "America's Team".

    Lackluster


Roster and Schedule info during Season only. Limited news-always find out faster on other more reliable and up to date sources. Also don’t post stories or podcasts on weekends which is when everything happens in NFL. Podcasts are lackluster except may be The Break and Draft Show with David Helman (their only knowledgeable staff member since departure of Bryan Broaddus) Broaddus was only one that made Talking Cowboys worth listening to with his vast knowledge. Nick Eatman is OK but Spagnola, who is always closed-minded and opinionated on show and articles, should have been the one fired to save the integrity of the show. I suggest 105.3 The Fan instead, now featuring Broaddus. Hanging with the Boys often makes me wonder why it exists. They never know, or want to know, anything about biggest part of the Spring, THE DRAFT, and rarely know what’s going on with the Cowboys. Nate needs to find different job. Not good radio voice-always sounds like he doesn’t give a $#*! They’d rather talk about fishing and GOT and concerts they went to, or what they did over the weekend. All in all, it’s hard to believe they’re even in the same building as the Cowboys.

    Dark mode


Holy cow this app is super bright white!!!  Very few apps these days actually hurt my eyes from the white-brightness and this is one of them. Only way to deal with it is to turn my screen brightness down to the point of barely being able to read the articles. Most apps have now given the option of dark mode these days and the Cowboys app needs to catch up. And please get rid of the auto play on the videos. Very unsettling having a video yelling at me as I hurriedly scramble to turn it down.
