# Natural_Language_Processing
This is a portfolio for my CS 4395: Human Language Technologies class taken at UTD.

## Overview of NLP
This [document](Overview_of_NLP.pdf) is an overview of natural language processing (NLP), which contains a few topics and approaches related to NLP and my personal interest in this field.

## Text Processing
This [document](homework1/Text_Processing.pdf) provides a brief overview of homework 1 about Text Processing covered in this class.

## WordNet
This [document](homework3/WordNet.ipynb) provides the notebook for research conducted over WordNet for this class.

## Word Guessing Game
This [document](homework2/homework2_axc190063.py) is the python file containing the code to a semi-working word guessing game.

## Sentence Parsing
This [document](homework5/axc190063_sentence_parsing.pdf) provides the models created for sentence parsing through PSG, dependency, and SRL parse tress for this class.

## N-grams
This [document](homework4/ngrams_narrative.pdf) provides an overview of n-grams and the formulas for probability, learned in this section, along with [program1](homework4/program1_axc190063.py) and [program2](homework4/program2_axc190063.py).

## Web Crawler
This [document](homework6/homework6_axc190063.py) provides the code that represents a web crawler, along with some [information](homework6/web_crawler.docx) about the web crawler.

## ACL Paper Summary
This [document](Reading_ACL_Papers.docx) provides a summary of an ACL research paper that I read for this assignment.

## Chatbot
This [document](Homework9/Bot.py) provides the code to the chatbot that my partner and I worked on for this assignment, that answers questions related to quantum physics. 

## Summary
Through this class, I was able to pick up a few skills in NLP and a little bit of ML as well. I was able to learn about different models, along with topics such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and more. As most of the assignments were done in Python, I picked up a grasp on a few new libraries, such as nltk, and new methods. The chatbot assignment, in particular, taught me a lot more about AI, which I am interested in pursuing in the future as well.
